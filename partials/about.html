                <p>
                    I am a strategic and results-driven <strong>Product Manager</strong> with over 15 years of
                    experience in industrial manufacturing, air compressors, and business development across the GCC and MENA region.
                    Throughout my career, I have led product lifecycle management, factory setup, supplier partnerships,
                    and regional market expansion for major industrial companies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My expertise bridges both commercial and operational functions, allowing me to align product strategy
                    with market needs while ensuring efficient production, cost optimization, and strong after-sales support.
                    I collaborate closely with engineering, sales, and marketing teams to deliver products that exceed
                    quality standards and meet customer expectations.

                    I am passionate about building scalable systems, optimizing processes, and developing strong
                    supplier and client relationships. My approach combines strategic planning, hands-on execution,
                    and data-driven decision-making to achieve sustainable business growth.
